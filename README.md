# Introduction to Gas Processing using NeqSim in Colab
This GitHub repository is the code and notebook base for the web module [Introduction to Gas Processing using NeqSim in Colab](/notebooks/examples_of_NeqSim_in_Colab.ipynb).

NeqSim Python/Colab is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator) is a Java library for estimation of fluid behavior and process design. The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of fluids.

[NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator)](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) is a library for estimation of fluid behaviour for oil and gas production. Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. In the notebooks listed in this page you will find examples of typical gas processing calculations using NeqSim in Colab, and will serve both as introduction to natural gas processing and to interactive use of NeqSim in a Python based notebook. The notebooks serves as a theoretical introduction and as a simulation tool for many processes found in the gas industry.

## Getting Started
