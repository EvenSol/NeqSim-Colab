# NeqSim Java API

This project is a demonstration of a container based NeqSim Rest API developed using the Quarkus Java Framework. 

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

In this API a TEG dehydration process is calculated using NeqSim. An example of using the API is given in [this notebook](https://github.com/EvenSol/NeqSim-Colab/blob/master/API/java/example/TEGprocess.ipynb).
