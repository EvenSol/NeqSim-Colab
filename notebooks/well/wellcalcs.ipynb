Developed by J.R. Brill and H. Beggs at the University of Tulsa in the 1960s, this method helps in predicting pressure drops for flowing gas-liquid mixtures in pipes.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Flow Pattern Prediction**:\n",
        "   Flow pattern is an essential component for subsequent calculations. The method categorizes flow patterns into:\n",
        "   - Bubble Flow\n",
        "   - Slug Flow\n",

        "The Beggs and Brill method, while empirical, provides a practical way of estimating pressure drops in multiphase flow scenarios, especially when other detailed mechanistic models might be computationally expensive or require more detailed input data. However, users should be aware of its limitations, and it might not be appropriate for all situations, especially in non-standard conditions or when very accurate predictions are necessary."
