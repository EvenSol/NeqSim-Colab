   "source": "# Background\nNorway has announced a strategy to electrify offshore oil and gas installations using power delivered from the mainland grid.\nSupplying an offshore field from land can significantly reduce emissions because gas turbines or diesel generators are replaced by electricity generated onshore, typically from low-carbon sources.\nThis example illustrates how a new 100 MW field could be connected to the existing grid."

   "source": "# Modeling approach\nPyPSA-Earth builds detailed electricity networks from open data. Here we restrict the network to Norway and then add an additional bus representing the offshore facility.\nThe connection to land is modeled as a `Link` with a nominal capacity of 100 MW. A constant 100 MW `Load` is attached to the offshore bus to represent the field's power requirement.\nRunning `lopf` performs a linear optimal power flow to verify that the network can supply the new demand."

   "source": "# Theory\nElectrifying offshore fields allows operators to replace onboard generation from gas turbines with mainland electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving efficiency.\nIn network studies PyPSA-Earth represents onshore and offshore locations as buses connected via high-voltage links. The optimal power flow determines whether the grid can supply the new demand without violating transmission constraints."
