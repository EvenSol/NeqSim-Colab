    "Norway is connected to Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom via several HVDC links. New interconnectors such as NordLink and North Sea Link expand capacity to trade electricity across borders. They enable Norwegian hydro reservoirs to balance wind and solar generation in the region and help import power during dry years. Modelling these links in PyPSA-Earth provides insight into price convergence and security of supply.\n\n",
    "Offshore wind resources in the North Sea have high capacity factors and could supply large amounts of clean electricity. Combined with onshore renewables these installations can replace fossil-fuelled generation for mainland consumption and for electrifying offshore platforms. Analysing different offshore wind build-out levels shows the need for grid reinforcements and new cables.\n\n",
    "Large hydro reservoirs already act as seasonal storage. Additional batteries and thermal storage together with flexible demand from industry, hydrogen electrolysers and smart EV charging are important to balance variable renewables. PyPSA-Earth allows optimisation of the mix of storage and demand-side measures."
