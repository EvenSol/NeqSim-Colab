    "Norway's electricity system is mainly based on hydropower, providing a large share of renewable generation.\n",
    "The country also has significant potential for offshore wind and increasing electrification of industry and transport.\n",

    "PyPSA-Earth automates the creation of such a model by pulling publicly available data from sources like OpenStreetMap,\n",
    "ENTSO-E statistics and reanalysis weather datasets. The resulting PyPSA network can be used for power flow studies or for optimisation of investment and dispatch.\n"
