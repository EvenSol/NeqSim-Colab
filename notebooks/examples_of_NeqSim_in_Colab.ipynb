    "[NeqSim (Non-Equilibrium Simulator)](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) is a library for calculation of fluid properties and process simulation. Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. In the notebooks listed in this page you will find examples of typical gas processing calculations using NeqSim in Colab, and will serve both as introduction to natural gas processing and to interactive use of NeqSim in a Python based notebook. The notebooks serves as a theoretical introduction and as a simulation tool for many processes found in the gas industry.\n",

The notebooks use the NeqSim package in Python and calculations are run directly from the web browser (by selecting Runtime and Run all in the main menu). The user will need to log on using their google account. To learn more about Colab see the [Welcome To Colaboratory page](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
